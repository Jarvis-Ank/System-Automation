# System-Automation
## Python and shell script to automate common desktop operations
  There are some tasks which we all do after our system starts, for me it goes like
- Opening Filemanager
- VS Code
- Browser etc

These tasks are automated using python and shell scripts, now using one command in Terminal "`bash start.sh`" the whole operation can be done quickly
